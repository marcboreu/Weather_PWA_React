## Uncontrollable Forces

* What are external forces that you have no control over?

## Imposed Constraints

* What constraints are imposed on your company or the solution?

## Difficult or Risky Value Propositions

* What value propositions will be difficult to achieve?
* What value propositions may be risky or backfire?

## What could go wrong?

* What could go wrong with this project?

## Customer Concerns

* What concerns or questions will your customers have?

## Risk Evaluation

Make a table and evaluate each risk. Consider the iron triangle: Scope, resources, and schedule.

|    Risk Name    | Impact Rating | Likelihood of Occurrence | Detection Difficulty | Overall Rating |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
|                 |               |                          |                      |                |

### Key

* H = high, M = medium, l = low
* Impact: H/M/L based on perceived impact level
* Likelihood of occurrence: H = 50-100%, M = 10-50%, L = 0-10%
* Detection difficulty: H = unlikely to find, L = likely to find
* Overall rating: What is your rating of the overall risk?
    * Can do intermediary rating such as ML or HM

## Risk Management

For each risk, identify:

* Risk avoidance strategies
* Risk mitigation strategies
* Contingency strategies

What risks can we:

* avoid?
* reduce likelihood of occurrence of?
* mitigate impact of?
* transfer elsewhere?

# Differentiation Strategy

Finding opportunity:

* What is desired?
	* What are customers' goals and activities?
	* What are their dreams, hopes, passions, aspirations, sources of joy and delight?
	* What are their fears, concerns, frustrations, aversions, or hassles?
* What is possible?
	* What are our capabilities and resources?

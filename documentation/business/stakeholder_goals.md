# Stakeholder Goals

Filling out this template:

* Review the stakeholder analysis documents to distill:
	* Value propositions
	* Goals for the system
	* Non-functional qualities
	* Requirements
* Use these goals to:
	* drive creation of principles
	* select architectural styles
	* Select mechanisms during the meta-arch phase
* Functional requirements are the starting point for use cases
* Quality goals are the starting point for quality requirements

**Table of Contents:**
1. [Stakeholder List](#stakeholder-list)
2. [Goals](#goals)
	1. [Functional](#functional-goals)
	2. [Quality](#quality-goals)
	3. [Architectural](#architectural)
3. [Goals by Milestone](#goals-by-milestone)

## Stakeholder List

* Optional
* List the stakeholders and link to their analyses

## Goals

* Use KJ (affinity) analysis
* Separate goals that relate to functionality from those that relate to system (runtime) qualities (e.g., performance, security) and architectural qualities (extensibility, reuse)

Record goals in the following format:

* <goal name>: goal statement
	* stakeholders (list of stakeholders who share that goal)


KJ Analysis:

* Analyze the response of a number of participates and organize related responses into categories
* Once grouping stabilize, a summary description or phrase that represents the category is placed at the top of the grouping
* The number of (not necessarily distinct) items in the group is placed in the header bar
	* This number represents the "vote" or indication of significance of the category
	* This is somewhat subjective, as you can get a higher "vote" by grouping two categories together
* Influence relationships between groups can be represented by arrows between them

### Functional Goals

### Quality Goals

### Architectural Goals

## Goals by Milestones

Group the goals, and then make a table for V1, V2, V3 or columns with major feature releases. Mark when a goal will be satisfied.

Multiple tables for different goal categories are acceptable.
